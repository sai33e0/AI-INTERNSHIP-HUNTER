# Resume Upload Fix TODO

## Tasks
- [x] Update `components/ui/FileUpload.tsx` to add a ref for the file input and an onClick handler on the upload area to trigger the file input

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test the file upload by clicking the upload area and selecting a file
- [x] Verify LinkedIn URL validation accepts common URL formats
